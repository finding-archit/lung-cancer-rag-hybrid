      "text": "In recent times, Lung cancer is the most common cause of mortality in both men and women around the world. Lung cancer is the second most well-known disease after heart disease. Although lung cancer prevention is impossible, early detection of lung cancer can effectively treat lung cancer at an early stage. The possibility of a patient's survival rate increasing if lung cancer is identified early. To detect and diagnose lung cancer in its early stages, a variety of data analysis and machine learning techniques have been applied. In this paper, we applied supervised machine learning algorithms like SVM (Support vector machine), ANN (Artificial neural networks), MLR (Multiple linear regression), and RF (random forest), to detect the early stages of lung tumors. The main purpose of this study is to examine the success of machine learning algorithms in detecting lung cancer at an early stage. When compared to all other supervised machine learning algorithms, the Random forest model produces a high result, with a 99.99% accuracy rate.",

      "text": "Cancer is a wide term and the most complex disease in people’s life. Cancer can cause by the development of uncontrollable cells which can be spread anywhere in the human body. General cancer symptoms are fatigue, weight loss, pain, cough, fever, lumps, etc. Cancer is also called a tumor. To save the lives of humans it is very important to detect quickly and correctly the initial stage of cancer. There are many kinds of cancer like breast, brain, lung, liver, skin cancer, etc. Lung cancer is a form of cancer which starts that the abnormal cells cluster together. Lung cancer is the main reason for death among both men and women all over the world. Worldwide after heart disease, Lung cancer is the second most frequent disease. Uncontrollable cell growth may be the reason for the death of the cancer patient. Early examination of lung tumors is critical in decreasing the risk of death from lung tumor disease. Lung cancer can spread very quickly to the brain, liver, bones, and adrenal glands, therefore, the initial diagnosis of lung cancer is very necessary. Every year, almost 1.3 million people pass away due to lung cancer around the world. In 2018, approximately 234,030 Americans will be diagnosed of which 121,480 males and 112,350 females. Due to lung cancer, approximately 121,680 deaths will occur of which 83,550 males and 70,500 females. Common ways to diagnose lung cancer include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), CT (Computed Tomography) scan, and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Lung carcinoma is another name for lung cancer. Lung cancer has two categories: SCLC (Small Cell Lung Cancer) and NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer). SCLC: It’s a generally rare form of lung cancer. Around 15% of lung cancer cases have a history of small cell lung cancer. Small lung cancer spread very quickly. NSCLC: It’s a quite frequent kind of lung cancer. Around 85% of lung cancer cases have a history of non-small cell lung cancer. This type of lung cancer is more dangerous than SCLC because it spread slowly. NSCLC is further divided into three categories: NSCLC has four stages which include Stage I, Stage II, Stage III, and Stage IV. In Stage I, cancer produces 60 to 80% in a single lung and doesn’t develop in lymph nodes or distant organs. In Stage II, 30 to 50% of cancer grows in lymph nodes, rather than distant organs. In stage III, the tumor expands 10 to 15% in nodes and builds in the center of the chest. In stage IV, the Tumor spread throughout the body. Many studies have been undertaken on the causes of lung cancer, with the conclusion that smoking is the primary cause. Smoking harms the lungs. In the United States, cigarette smoking is a factor of 80 to 90% of deaths due to lung cancer. Other tobacco products such as cigars, pipes, or snuff (a powdered form of tobacco) raise the risk of lung cancer and other kinds of cancer such as mouth cancer. The use of tobacco smoking for a long time begins with lung cancer. According to the survey, smoking caused lung cancer in 90% of males and 75 to 80% of females. It is a reality that 10 to 15% of people who never smoke in their life contain lung cancer. The reason for lung cancer may be passive smoking, air pollution, asbestos, and radon gas.",

    "Literature Review": {
      "text": "Machine learning is a method of diagnosis of lung cancer which is the leading cause of death worldwide. Many machine learning applications are already used in the field of Lung cancer detection. In previous work, many researchers have used image processing methods, machine learning approaches, or hybrid techniques to diagnose lung cancer. In this paper [8] Author used the clinical images dataset for the image processing methodology. The image processing approach is divided into five different steps: 1) collect images 2) image processing and segmentation 3) extraction of features 4) classification of images 5) performance evaluation. Seven classifiers as KNN( k-nearest neighbours), SVM(support vector machine), DT(Decision tree), MNB(Multinomial naïve Bayes), SGD(Stochastic gradient descent), RF(Random forest), and MLP( Multi-layer perceptron) was used to evaluate the performance based on the following parameters: accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall and then calculated using a confusion matrix. In the end, MLP obtains higher accuracy with the value of 88.55% as compared to other classifiers. The major goal of this paper[10] is to use image transformation and machine learning methods to identify lung cancer and its phases. Many steps are involved in the image processing approach, First, 200 CT scan reports and blood samples with CT scan images were used as an input for image processing. Secondly, make a Grayscale image out of an RGB image. To convert the RGB image to a Grayscale image first we find out the average of the colour image and then replace the RGB pixel with the average. Formula of average [average = R+G+B/3]. In the third step, a median filter was used to extract the noise from a grayscale picture. In the fourth step, the grayscale picture is converted to a binary image. The grayscale image has(From 0 to 255 )pixel range and the binary image has (0, 1). When converting a grayscale picture to a binary image, the threshold value 175 is occupied. In the fifth segmentation step, decrease the irrelevant information from the image and convert the duplicate CT scan image into an informative which is easily examined in detail. In the feature extraction step, the segmented output is used as an input for the feature extraction. Feature extraction is a technique for extracting a pattern from a duplicate image using algorithms. These features, such as Area, Perimeter, and Eccentricity, are provided by feature extraction. In the last step, the Support vector machine (SVM) arranges data and manages the pattern. SVM was used for classification and regression problems and categorized positive and negative samples of lung cancer images. In this paper, the SVM classifier is used as compared to other classifiers like Decision trees, Naïve Bayes, and Random forest because SVM is less time-consuming. In this study [3], To identify the lung tumor access the dataset from Standard Digital Image Database. The dataset consists of 247 CT images, 154 images labelled with a nodule, and 93 images labelled without a nodule. The dataset was divided into two parts: training and testing. Randomly, for the training set, 70% of the dataset was employed, while for the testing set 30% of the dataset was employed. PCA(Principal component analysis), KNN( k-nearest neighbours), SVM(Support vector machine), NB(Naïve Bayes), DT(Decision tree), and ANN( Artificial Neural Network) are among the machine learning techniques used to detect lung cancer. Then compare all the classifier’s accuracy before and after preprocessing. In the end, ANN has higher accuracy of 82, 43% than other classifiers after image processing, and the Decision tree has higher accuracy of 93, 24% than other algorithms without image processing. In this paper [11], To save the lives of humans by analyzing the initial stage of lung cancer many machine learning algorithms are used. Lung cancer datasets are sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Data. World. The K-fold cross-validation method splits datasets into two parts: training and testing. Many classification methods are used to attain accuracy including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine is used and then compared the accuracy of each classifier with another classifier. SVM has a higher accuracy of 99.2% than all other classifiers. In this study [7], Author mostly focused on the segmentation and classification method. An Unsharp mask filter is used to sharpen the image. In image processing, an unsharp mask is used to convert the blurred image into original images. For calculating the background and foreground color intensity level of the image many thresholding methods are used but here we use the OTSU’S thresholding. The mean of OTSU’S thresholding to estimate the following parameters ( weight, mean, variance) of background and foreground of all levels. To detect the cancer region and actual affected area we used an Adaptive Canny algorithm and this method was estimated over Otsu's global thresholding method. For the segmentation process, the k-nearest neighbour classification method is used. The KNN method has some effective applications like machine learning, pattern recognition, data mining, object recognition, etc. To calculate the classification results from Bayesian Regularization neural network is used. BRNN attains high accuracy with a value of 99.5%. The Author [5] has proposed a CAD (Computer-aided diagnosis) system using the SVM to categorise abnormal or normal images using the CT images dataset. The CAD system has four phases to detect lung cancer from CT images. These stages are preprocessing of images, extraction of features, selection of features, and categorization. In this study, a Gray level co-occurrence matrix was applied to extract image information such as colour, shape, texture, etc, and ANT Colony Optimization was employed as a feature selection method for better outcomes. To categorize the normal and abnormal photos, two machine learning classifiers, ANN and SVM, were applied. ANN achieve high accuracy of 98.40% as compared to SVM's accuracy of 93.2%. Furthermore, [12] Deep Learning Approach is employed to diagnose lung cancer at the initial stages which are very important to decrease the possibility of death. In this study, the TensorFlow library is used to diagnose lung cancer. SPIE-AAPM dataset used consists of 70 CT images. The training set is made up of 40 photographs, while the test set is made up of 30 images. 3D Convolutional Neural Network is utilized to classify the lung nodules which can be benign or cancerous. To calculate the performance of the model 30 CT images are used as a resulting in which 17 patients are malignant and 13 patients are benign. Several metrics are used to assess the performance of the classification method but in this work, a confusion matrix is employed to evaluate the achievement of binary classification. The Confusion Matrix shows 70% accuracy of 3D CNN. This work [13] has proposed the deep residual network to detect lung cancer using the CT scan images dataset that is in DICOM (digital imaging and communication in medicine) image format. First, perform the preprocessing method on the dataset. In preprocessing, to determine and split lung nodules perform many regions growing and morphological operations and then used the UNet and ResNet models for feature extraction. In segmentation, analyze the distinctive features from the CT scan images. In this work two tree-based classifiers as XGBoost and RandomForest used. In the end, compared the accuracy of the proposed models. UNet+RandoomForest individually get 74% accuracy, ResNet+XSBoost achieved 76% accuracy, and the combination of UNet+RandoomForest and ResNet+XSBoost obtain 84% accuracy. The Multi-class SVM classifier is used in the work [14] to detect and predict lung cancer. In this work, MATLAB was used for built an algorithm to detect and predict lung cancer. In each phase of classification, image enhancement and segmentation were done separately. Image enhancement is an approach for improving the quality and information of a data image. Many approaches such as image scaling, spatial transformation, and contrast enhancement have been promoted to improve images. Watershed transformed is used for segmentation to achieve a better resolution in CT images and Gray Level Co-Occurance method is used for feature extraction. For classifying cancer nodules SVM classifier is used that is used for both classification and relapse purposes. Our proposed method achieves higher accuracy. This research work [15] addressed various segmentation approaches such as Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) and Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) clustering algorithms methods. To diagnose the early stage of lung cancer used Sputum color images. In this study, a thresholding classifier was used to handle the problem of extreme fluctuation in the grey level and the related contrast between the pictures with 98% accuracy. The results of HNN Segmentation exceed the results of FCM because FCM failed in extracting the nucleus and cytoplasm areas. [16]Developed a computer-assisted detection approach to distinguish between malignant and non-cancerous tissue in DICOM images.CNN was used for feature extraction. Many machine learning classifiers were used to classify the cancerous and normal images and compared their accuracy with each other to determine which one is best for diagnosing lung and pancreatic tumors.",

      "Text": "In this paper [8] Author used the clinical images dataset for the image processing methodology. The image processing approach is divided into five different steps: 1) collect images 2) image processing and segmentation 3) extraction of features 4) classification of images 5) performance evaluation. Seven classifiers as KNN( k-nearest neighbours), SVM(support vector machine), DT(Decision tree), MNB(Multinomial naïve Bayes), SGD(Stochastic gradient descent), RF(Random forest), and MLP( Multi-layer perceptron) was used to evaluate the performance based on the following parameters: accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall and then calculated using a confusion matrix. In the end, MLP obtains higher accuracy with the value of 88.55% as compared to other classifiers. The major goal of this paper[10] is to use image transformation and machine learning methods to identify lung cancer and its phases. Many steps are involved in the image processing approach, First, 200 CT scan reports and blood samples with CT scan images were used as an input for image processing. Secondly, make a Grayscale image out of an RGB image. To convert the RGB image to a Grayscale image first we find out the average of the colour image and then replace the RGB pixel with the average. Formula of average [average = R+G+B/3]. In the third step, a median filter was used to extract the noise from a grayscale picture. In the fourth step, the grayscale picture is converted to a binary image. The grayscale image has(From 0 to 255 )pixel range and the binary image has (0, 1). When converting a grayscale picture to a binary image, the threshold value 175 is occupied. In the fifth segmentation step, decrease the irrelevant information from the image and convert the duplicate CT scan image into an informative which is easily examined in detail. In the feature extraction step, the segmented output is used as an input for the feature extraction. Feature extraction is a technique for extracting a pattern from a duplicate image using algorithms. These features, such as Area, Perimeter, and Eccentricity, are provided by feature extraction. In the last step, the Support vector machine (SVM) arranges data and manages the pattern. SVM was used for classification and regression problems and categorized positive and negative samples of lung cancer images. In this paper, the SVM classifier is used as compared to other classifiers like Decision trees, Naïve Bayes, and Random forest because SVM is less time-consuming. In this study [3], To identify the lung tumor access the dataset from Standard DigitalImage Database. The dataset consists of 247 CT images, 154 images labelled with a nodule, and 93 images labelled without a nodule. The dataset was divided into two parts: training and testing. Randomly, for the training set, 70% of the dataset was employed, while for the testing set 30% of the dataset was employed. PCA(Principal component analysis), KNN( k-nearest neighbours), SVM(Support vector machine), NB(Naïve Bayes), DT(Decision tree), and ANN( Artificial Neural Network) are among the machine learning techniques used to detect lung cancer. Then compare all the classifier’s accuracy before and after preprocessing. In the end, ANN has higher accuracy of 82, 43% than other classifiers after image processing, and the Decision tree has higher accuracy of 93, 24% than other algorithms without image processing. In this paper [11], To save the lives of humans by analyzing the initial stage of lung cancer many machine learning algorithms are used. Lung cancer datasets are sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Data. World. The K-fold cross-validation method splits datasets into two parts: training and testing. Many classification methods are used to attain accuracy including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine is used and then compared the accuracy of each classifier with another classifier. SVM has a higher accuracy of 99.2% than all other classifiers. In this study [7], Author mostly focused on the segmentation and classification method. An Unsharp mask filter is used to sharpen the image. In image processing, an unsharp mask is used to convert the blurred image into original images. For calculating the background and foreground color intensity level of the image many thresholding methods are used but here we use the OTSU’S thresholding. The mean of OTSU’S thresholding to estimate the following parameters ( weight, mean, variance) of background and foreground of all levels. To detect the cancer region and actual affected area we used an Adaptive Canny algorithm and this method was estimated over Otsu's global thresholding method. For the segmentation process, the k-nearest neighbour classification method is used. The KNN method has some effective applications like machine learning, pattern recognition, data mining, object recognition, etc. To calculate the classification results from Bayesian Regularization neural network is used. BRNN attains high accuracy with a value of 99.5%. The Author [5] has proposed a CAD (Computer-aided diagnosis) system using the SVM to categorise abnormal or normal images using the CT images dataset. The CAD system has four phases to detect lung cancer from CT images. These stages are preprocessing of images, extraction of features, selection of features, and categorization. In this study, a Gray level co-occurrence matrix was applied to extract image information such as colour, shape, texture, etc, and ANT Colony Optimization was employed as a feature selection method for better outcomes. To categorize the normal and abnormal photos, two machine learning classifiers, ANN and SVM, were applied. ANN achieve high accuracy of 98.40% as compared to SVM's accuracy of 93.2%. Furthermore, [12] Deep Learning Approach is employed to diagnose lung cancer at the initial stages which are very important to decrease the possibility of death. In this study, the TensorFlow library is used to diagnose lung cancer. SPIE-AAPM dataset used consists of 70 CT images. The training set is made up of 40 photographs, while the test set is made up of 30 images. 3D Convolutional Neural Network is utilized to classify the lung nodules which can be benign or cancerous. To calculate the performance of the model 30 CT images are used as a resulting in which 17 patients are malignant and 13 patients are benign. Several metrics are used to assess the performance of the classification method but in this work, a confusion matrix is employed to evaluate the achievement of binary classification. The Confusion Matrix shows 70% accuracy of 3D CNN. This work [13] has proposed the deep residual network to detect lung cancer using the CT scan images dataset that is in DICOM (digital imaging and communication in medicine) image format. First, perform the preprocessing method on the dataset. In preprocessing, to determine and split lung nodules perform many regions growing and morphological operations and then used the UNet and ResNet models for feature extraction. In segmentation, analyze the distinctive features from the CT scan images. In this work two tree-based classifiers as XGBoost and RandomForest used. In the end, compared the accuracy of the proposed models. UNet+RandoomForest individually get 74% accuracy, ResNet+XSBoost achieved 76% accuracy, and the combination of UNet+RandoomForest and ResNet+XSBoost obtain 84% accuracy. The Multi-class SVM classifier is used in the work [14] to detect and predict lung cancer. In this work, MATLAB was used for built an algorithm to detect and predict lung cancer. In each phase of classification, image enhancement and segmentation were done separately. Image enhancement is an approach for improving the quality and information of a data image. Many approaches such as image scaling, spatial transformation, and contrast enhancement have been promoted to improve images. Watershed transformed is used for segmentation to achieve a better resolution in CT images and Gray Level Co-Occurance method is used for feature extraction. For classifying cancer nodules SVM classifier is used that is used for both classification and relapse purposes. Our proposed method achieves higher accuracy. This research work [15] addressed various segmentation approaches such as Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) and Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) clustering algorithms methods. To diagnose the early stage of lung cancer used Sputum color images. In this study, a thresholding classifier was used to handle the problem of extreme fluctuation in the grey level and the related contrast between the pictures with 98% accuracy. The results of HNN Segmentation exceed the results of FCM because FCM failed in extracting the nucleus and cytoplasm areas. [16]Developed a computer-assisted detection approach to distinguish between malignant and non-cancerous tissue in DICOM images.CNN was used for feature extraction. Many machine learning classifiers were used to classify the cancerous and normal images and compared their accuracy with each other to determine which one is best for diagnosing lung and pancreatic tumors.",

      "Text": "In previous times, Lung cancer detection was a very difficult and time-consuming task because a doctor has done multiple tests on a patient to confirm whether the patient has lung cancer or not. Nowadays, many machine learning classifiers have become more important for diagnosing and detecting lung cancer. The main goal of this work is to find a way to detect lung cancer early. Lung nodule classification is benign, malignant, and has no cancer. The supervised machine learning methods utilized in this study are the Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Multiple Linear Regression. As seen in the performance chart, each machine learning classifier delivers different outcomes on the same lung cancer dataset. When compared to other supervised machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest model gives the best result with an accuracy of 99.99 per cent, according to the proper classification and confusion matrices. For future work, Additional preprocessing improve the accuracy rate of other supervised machine learning algorithms.",
